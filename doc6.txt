const fetchData = async () => {: This defines an asynchronous function called fetchData.
let response = await fetch("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts");: This line fetches data from the given URL. await means it waits for the data to be fetched before moving to the next line.
let data = await response.json();: This line converts the fetched data into a JSON format. await ensures it waits until the data is converted.
setCards(data);: This line updates the cards state variable with the fetched data.
console.log(data);: This line logs the fetched data to the console for debugging purposes.



useEffect(() => { fetchData(); }, []);: This line runs the fetchData function once when the component is first rendered. The empty array [] means it only runs once.
